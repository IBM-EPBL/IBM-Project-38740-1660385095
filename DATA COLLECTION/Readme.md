Data Collection:
  Two datasets are collected in this phase:
  1. [T1.csv](https://github.com/IBM-EPBL/IBM-Project-38740-1660385095/blob/main/DATA%20COLLECTION/T1.csv)
    
    This dataset is given in nalaiya thiran. This dataset contains parameters: Date & Time, Actual Power, Theoretical Power, Wind speed and Wind direction.
    
  2. [Windfarm.xlsx](https://github.com/IBM-EPBL/IBM-Project-38740-1660385095/blob/main/DATA%20COLLECTION/Windfarm.xlsx)
  
    This dataset is collected by Vidhyambika. This dataset is a real-time dataset collected for 2 years(2019-2020). This dataset contains all the required parameters i.e Temperature, Humidity, Wind speeds at different heights of windmill, Wind directions at different heights of windmill, Date & Time, Atmosphere and Actual power. 
    
    Thus, the dataset which will be used in this project is Windfarm.xlsx
