# TRAINING AND TESTING DIFFERENT MODELS ON TEST
## Model 1: 

1. Uses Random Forest Regressor
2. All the parameters are taken into account for training and testing
3. Gives the highest accuracy of all 4 models
4. Hyper parameter tuning(Random Search model) is performed

## Model 2:

1. Uses Random Forest Regressor
2. Two parameters i.e Wind speed at 10meters and Wind direction (in degree)at 10 meters - columns
3. Gives accuracy less than model 1
4. Hyper parameter tuning(Random Search model) is performed

## Model 3:

1. Uses Support Vector Regression
2. All parameters of the dataset is used
3. Gives accuracy less than model 2

## Model 4

1. Uses Multi linear Regression
2. All parameters of the dataset is used
3. Gives accuracy less than model 3

Therefore, the best performing model among all these 4 is Model 1
